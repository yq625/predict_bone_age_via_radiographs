# predict_bone_age_via_radiographs

Pediatric bone age assessment via hand radiographs has been used in the clinical practice for more 
than 75 years to gauge the skeletal maturity of a child, which in turns reveals different factors such
as chronological age, nutrition, genetics, and disease states. Conventional methods are manual,
tedious and time-consuming, which necessitates the need for automated systems that could
determine bone age with high efficiency and accuracy. Deep learning is a feasible solution, and
thus, in 2017 the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) launched the Pediatric Bone
Age Challenge to invite teams and individuals to create models that predicts bone age via hand
radiographs. As a group, we developed three different convolutional neural networks (CNN). Our
best model, which is based on VGG16 network, had a mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 9.63
months on the test set, which is competitive relative to other participants in the challenge
leaderboard.
